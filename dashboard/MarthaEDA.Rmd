### Filtering for most frequent actors by Director Selected.

[ ] A can be renamed to a temporary variable that makes it easier to keep track of the changing dataset. 

[ ] Script for filtering based on director,actor or writer can be a function call. 
```{r}
A<-people%>%
  filter(director == "Spike Lee")%>%
  select(actors)



unnest_tokens(A, split, actors, token = str_split, pattern = ",")%>%
   group_by(split)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  head(20)


B<-people%>%
  filter(director == "Spike Lee")%>%
  select(writer)



unnest_tokens(B, split, writer, token = str_split, pattern = ",")%>%
   group_by(split)%>%
  count()%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  head(20)

```
