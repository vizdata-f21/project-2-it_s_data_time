## Introduction

We would like to create a tool for users to easily explore movie data.
There are many movies out there, and we figured that building a
dashboard with varying functionalities is appropriate to view this data,
as it allows users to interact with the data in whatever way they
choose. We wanted to build a dashboard with movies because we believe it
is an interesting subject, and we were able to find a large, complete
dataset with various different variables.

## Approach

We will use the “movies” dataset from IMBd for this project. It includes
three different CSVs, one with movie data, one with movie ratings, and
one with casting information. In total, there are 85,855 movies from
1894 to 2020 with various different variables such as description,
average rating, number of votes, and genre. The dataset also includes an
aggregated group of 835,513 cast members with information such as their
importance in the movie and characters played. We plan to join the three
different CSVs together in our analysis, based on common variables such
as movie titles and move ids.

## Project Structure

This project contains a proposal and movieanalysis folder. The proposal folder 
contains the initial project proposal and the movieanalysis folder contains
the script and data needed to run the shiny dashboard.
